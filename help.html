        <strong>What is anger really?</strong> <br /><br />
        Anger is
        <i
          >"an emotional state that varies in intensity from mild irritation to
          intense fury and rage"</i
        >
        according to Charles Spielberger, PhD, a psychologist who specializes in
        the study of anger. Like other emotions, it is accompanied by
        physiological and biological changes; when you get angry, your heart
        rate and blood pressure go up, as do the levels of your energy hormones,
        adrenaline, and noradrenaline.<br /><br />Anger can be caused by both
        external and internal events. You could be angry at a specific person
        (such as a coworker or supervisor) or event (a traffic jam, a canceled
        flight), or your anger could be caused by worrying or brooding about
        your personal problems. Memories of traumatic or enraging events can
        also trigger angry feelings. Read more
